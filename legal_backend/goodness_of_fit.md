Normalized Root Mean Squared Error (NRMSE) is a variant of RMSE that is normalized to make the measure scale-independent, allowing for comparison across different datasets or models with varying scales. By normalizing RMSE, we can better assess the goodness of fit relative to the range or magnitude of the observed data. Hereâ€™s how you can use NRMSE to decide the goodness of fit:

### 1. Understanding Normalized RMSE (NRMSE)

Normalized RMSE adjusts the RMSE value to make it dimensionless, facilitating comparisons across different scales. There are several ways to normalize RMSE, but the two most common methods are:

- **Normalization by the Range of Observed Data**: 
  \[
  \text{NRMSE} = \frac{\text{RMSE}}{y_{\text{max}} - y_{\text{min}}}
  \]
  where \(y_{\text{max}}\) and \(y_{\text{min}}\) are the maximum and minimum observed values, respectively.

- **Normalization by the Mean of Observed Data**:
  \[
  \text{NRMSE} = \frac{\text{RMSE}}{\bar{y}}
  \]
  where \(\bar{y}\) is the mean of the observed values.

### 2. How to Calculate NRMSE

To calculate NRMSE, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate RMSE**: First, compute the RMSE using the formula:
   \[
   \text{RMSE} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}
   \]

2. **Choose Normalization Method**: Decide whether to normalize by the range of the data or the mean of the data.

3. **Calculate NRMSE**:
   - **By Range**:
     \[
     \text{NRMSE (Range)} = \frac{\text{RMSE}}{y_{\text{max}} - y_{\text{min}}}
     \]
   - **By Mean**:
     \[
     \text{NRMSE (Mean)} = \frac{\text{RMSE}}{\bar{y}}
     \]

### 3. Example Calculation

Let's consider the following observed and predicted values:

- Observed values (\( y \)): [3, 5, 2, 8]
- Predicted values (\( \hat{y} \)): [2.5, 5.5, 2, 8]

**Step-by-Step Calculation:**

1. **Calculate RMSE**:
   - Squared differences: \((3 - 2.5)^2 = 0.25, (5 - 5.5)^2 = 0.25, (2 - 2)^2 = 0, (8 - 8)^2 = 0\)
   - Sum of squared differences: \(0.25 + 0.25 + 0 + 0 = 0.5\)
   - MSE: \(\frac{0.5}{4} = 0.125\)
   - RMSE: \(\sqrt{0.125} \approx 0.354\)

2. **Normalize by Range**:
   - Maximum observed value: \(y_{\text{max}} = 8\)
   - Minimum observed value: \(y_{\text{min}} = 2\)
   - Range: \(y_{\text{max}} - y_{\text{min}} = 8 - 2 = 6\)
   - NRMSE (Range): \(\frac{0.354}{6} \approx 0.059\)

3. **Normalize by Mean**:
   - Mean of observed values: \(\bar{y} = \frac{3 + 5 + 2 + 8}{4} = 4.5\)
   - NRMSE (Mean): \(\frac{0.354}{4.5} \approx 0.079\)

### 4. Interpreting NRMSE

- **NRMSE Values**: The value of NRMSE gives an indication of the error magnitude relative to the scale of the data. A lower NRMSE value indicates a better fit of the model, while a higher value indicates a worse fit.

- **Goodness of Fit**: There is no strict cutoff for what constitutes a "good" NRMSE because it depends on the context and domain-specific requirements. However, some general rules of thumb are:
  - **NRMSE < 0.1**: Typically considered a very good fit.
  - **NRMSE between 0.1 and 0.2**: Indicates a reasonable fit.
  - **NRMSE > 0.2**: Suggests a poorer fit, indicating that the model's predictions are not very accurate.

- **Relative Comparisons**: NRMSE is most useful when comparing the performance of different models on the same dataset or the same model across different datasets. A model with a lower NRMSE is generally preferred as it indicates smaller prediction errors relative to the scale of the data.

- **Choosing the Normalization Method**: 
  - **Range**: Normalizing by the range is useful when you want to understand the error relative to the spread of the data. This is especially helpful when the data has outliers or a broad range.
  - **Mean**: Normalizing by the mean is useful when you want to understand the error relative to the average value of the data. This can be helpful when comparing datasets with different means but similar distributions.

### 5. Practical Considerations

- **Data Characteristics**: Consider the characteristics of your data when interpreting NRMSE. Data with a wide range or significant outliers may lead to different interpretations of NRMSE.
  
- **Application-Specific Benchmarks**: Different fields have different expectations for what constitutes an acceptable NRMSE. For example, in meteorological forecasting, a higher NRMSE might be acceptable compared to engineering applications where precision is critical.

By using NRMSE, you can gain a clearer understanding of model performance in a way that accounts for the scale of the data, making it easier to make informed decisions about model selection and evaluation.
